# Design Principles & Best Practices

- Modern C++ (C++17/20), zero-cost abstractions
- RAII and exception safety throughout
- Composable, unopinionated architecture
- Robust error handling and resource cleanup
- Use GoogleTest for unit/integration tests
- Benchmark performance in `benchmarks/`
- Document all public APIs and config options
